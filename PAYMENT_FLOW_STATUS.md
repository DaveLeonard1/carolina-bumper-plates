# Payment Flow - Current Status & Assessment

## 📋 **Intended Flow**
1. ✅ Products sync to Stripe product catalog (sandbox mode)
2. ✅ Customer completes preorder form at `/checkout`
3. ✅ Customer can modify order freely until payment link is created
4. ✅ Admin clicks "Create Payment Link" on each order
5. ⚠️ Payment link should be emailed to customer **(NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION)**
6. ✅ Customer pays via Stripe payment link
7. ✅ Webhook updates order status to "paid" and locks order
8. ✅ Only admin can modify paid orders

---

## ✅ **What's Working**

### **1. Product Sync to Stripe**
- **Location**: `/admin/stripe-products`
- **API**: `/api/admin/sync-stripe-products`
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional
- Products sync to Stripe catalog with prices
- Stripe price IDs are stored in database

### **2. Checkout Process**
- **Location**: `/checkout`
- **API**: `/api/checkout`
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional
- Customer completes form with order details
- Order created in database with `status: "pending"`
- Customer can access order via `/my-account`

### **3. Order Modification Before Payment**
- **Location**: `/modify-order?order=ORDER_NUMBER`
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional
- Customers can modify orders when:
  - `order_locked = false`
  - `payment_link_url = null`
  - `payment_status != "paid"`

### **4. Payment Link Creation**
- **Location**: Admin actions on `/admin/orders` or `/admin/orders/[id]`
- **API**: `/api/create-payment-link`
- **Status**: ✅ Functional - locks order properly
- **Process**:
  1. Verifies order exists and has no existing payment link
  2. Loads order items and matches them to Stripe products
  3. Creates/retrieves Stripe customer
  4. Creates Stripe Checkout Session with line items
  5. **Updates order**:
     - `payment_link_url` = session URL
     - `order_locked` = `true`
     - `payment_status` = `"pending_payment"`
     - `order_locked_reason` = "Payment link created"
  6. Adds timeline event

### **5. Payment Webhook Handler**
- **Location**: `/api/stripe/webhook`
- **Event**: `checkout.session.completed`
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional
- **Process**:
  1. Receives webhook from Stripe after payment
  2. Finds order by session ID or metadata
  3. **Updates order**:
     - `payment_status` = `"paid"`
     - `status` = `"paid"`
     - `paid_at` = timestamp
  4. Adds timeline event
  5. Updates customer's last payment date

### **6. Order Locking Logic**
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly
- Order is locked if ANY of these are true:
  - `order_locked = true`
  - `payment_link_url` is set
  - `payment_status = "paid"`
- Locked orders cannot be modified by customers
- Only admins can modify locked/paid orders

## ⚠️ **What's Missing / Needs Fixing**

### **1. Email Notification System** 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**Problem**: Payment links are generated but NOT emailed to customers

**Current State**:
- Payment link is stored in database
- Customer can see link in `/my-account` if they check
- But NO automated email is sent

**Needed**:
```typescript
// After payment link creation in /api/create-payment-link/route.ts
// Line ~370 (after order update succeeds)

// Send email to customer
await sendPaymentLinkEmail({
  to: customerData.email,
  customerName: `${customerData.first_name} ${customerData.last_name}`,
  orderNumber: order.order_number,
  paymentUrl: session.url,
  orderTotal: order.subtotal,
})
```

**Implementation Options**:
1. **Resend** (recommended for Next.js)
2. **SendGrid**
3. **AWS SES**
4. **Mailgun**

### **2. Email Confirmations** 🟡 **IMPORTANT**
Missing email notifications for:
- ✉️ Order confirmation after checkout
- ✉️ Payment link created (see above)
- ✉️ Payment received confirmation
- ✉️ Order status updates

### **3. Admin Dashboard UX** 🟡 **NICE TO HAVE**
- Bulk "Create Payment Links" button exists but could show:
  - Which orders have links already
  - Which links have been clicked
  - Which payments are pending
- Copy payment link button for manual sharing

## 🔧 **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Priority** (Fix Payment Flow):
1. **Implement email service** for payment link delivery
2. **Add email templates** for professional look
3. **Test end-to-end** with real Stripe test card

### **Short Term** (Improve UX):
1. **Order confirmation email** after checkout
2. **Payment received email** after successful payment
3. **Admin email notifications** when orders are placed

### **Future Enhancements**:
1. **Email click tracking** - know when customer views payment link
2. **Payment reminders** - auto-send reminder if not paid in X days
3. **SMS notifications** as backup
4. **Customer email preferences** - let them choose notification types

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### **Manual Test Flow**:
1. [ ] Create order via `/checkout`
2. [ ] Verify order appears in `/my-account` as "pending"
3. [ ] Try to modify order - should work
4. [ ] Admin creates payment link
5. [ ] Verify order is locked (cannot modify)
6. [ ] **Check if email is sent** ⚠️ (currently NO)
7. [ ] Customer clicks payment link
8. [ ] Customer pays with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
9. [ ] Webhook fires and marks order as "paid"
10. [ ] Verify order shows as "paid" in customer account
11. [ ] Try to modify paid order - should be blocked

### **Stripe Test Cards**:
- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Declined**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **3D Secure**: `4000 0027 6000 3184`

## 📊 **Current Database Schema**

### **Orders Table** (relevant fields):
```sql
- id (uuid)
- order_number (text)
- payment_status (text) -- "pending", "pending_payment", "paid"
- payment_link_url (text) -- Stripe checkout URL
- payment_link_created_at (timestamp)
- order_locked (boolean)
- order_locked_reason (text)
- stripe_checkout_session_id (text)
- stripe_payment_intent_id (text)
- paid_at (timestamp)
- status (text) -- "pending", "paid", "cancelled"
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Choose email provider** (recommend Resend for Next.js)
2. **Install email package**: `npm install resend` or `@sendgrid/mail`
3. **Create email templates** (React Email or HTML)
4. **Add to payment link API** after successful link creation
5. **Test with real email address**
6. **Deploy to production** once tested
