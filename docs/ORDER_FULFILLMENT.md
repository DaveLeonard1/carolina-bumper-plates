# Order Fulfillment Process

This document describes the order fulfillment process for Carolina Bumper Plates, including the new "fulfilled" status in the order lifecycle.

## Order Status Flow

The order status lifecycle now includes the following stages:

1. **pending** - Initial state when a preorder is submitted
2. **invoiced** - Payment link has been generated and sent to the customer
3. **paid** - Customer has completed payment via Stripe
4. **fulfilled** - Order has been prepared for shipping/delivery (NEW)
5. **shipped** - Order has been shipped to the customer

## Fulfillment Process

### Admin Interface

1. Once an order has been paid, it will appear in the admin interface with status "paid"
2. The admin can click the "Mark as Fulfilled" button to indicate the order has been fulfilled
3. The system will:
   - Update the order status to "fulfilled"
   - Record a fulfillment timestamp
   - Add an entry to the order timeline
   - Send an email notification to the customer
   - Trigger any configured webhooks

### Technical Implementation

The fulfillment feature consists of:

#### 1. Database Changes
- Added `fulfilled_at` timestamp column
- Added `fulfillment_notes` text column
- Updated documentation for the `status` text column to include "fulfilled"

#### 2. Admin API
- Enhanced the PATCH endpoint at `/api/admin/orders/[id]/route.ts` to:
  - Allow "mark_fulfilled" action for orders with "paid" status
  - Update the order status and record fulfillment timestamp
  - Add timeline entry for fulfillment event

#### 3. Admin UI
- Added "Mark as Fulfilled" button in the order actions panel
- Button only appears for orders with "paid" status
- Includes appropriate confirmation and validation

#### 4. Email Notifications
- Added "order-fulfilled" email template
- Implemented `sendFulfillmentEmail` method in the email service
- Automatic email sent to customer when order is fulfilled

#### 5. Webhook Integration
- Enhanced webhook system to support "order_fulfilled" event
- Uses existing Zapier webhook system for integration

## Integration Points

### Customer-Facing UI
When implementing customer-facing order status displays, ensure the "fulfilled" status is properly handled and displayed with appropriate messaging.

### Reporting & Analytics
When building reporting or analytics tools, include "fulfilled" in order status filters and metrics. Useful metrics might include:
- Time from payment to fulfillment
- Current orders awaiting fulfillment
- Fulfillment rate over time

### API Documentation
Any external API documentation should include "fulfilled" as a possible order status. The status transition rules should note that orders can move from "paid" to "fulfilled" status.

### Search/Filtering
When implementing search or filtering functionality, include "fulfilled" as a filter option for order status.

## Testing the Fulfillment Process

1. Create a test order via the preorder form
2. Generate a payment link
3. Complete payment using Stripe test card
4. Verify order status changes to "paid"
5. In admin interface, click "Mark as Fulfilled"
6. Verify:
   - Order status changes to "fulfilled"
   - Email notification is sent
   - Timeline shows fulfillment event
   - Database records fulfillment timestamp

## Troubleshooting

Common issues with the fulfillment process:

1. **Email not sending**: Check Mailgun configuration and logs
2. **Button not appearing**: Verify order status is "paid" and not another status
3. **API error**: Check server logs for details on the specific error
